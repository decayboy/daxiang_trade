## Daxiang Trading Robot - a auto trading system for Bitmex    
[demo]()

## Introduction    
- Simple strategy, robust system, plus risk management make the Daxiang trading robot, as I believe that risk management is a thousand times more important than trading strategy.   
- The system supports parameterization and modularity, which means it's easier to control and scale the system.    
- The system supports backtesting and a simple dashboard   

## Installation

## Notes   
Special thanks for project [ebisu](https://github.com/noda-sin/ebisu), Bitmex sample project [sample-market-maker](https://github.com/BitMEX/sample-market-maker) and Bitmex [connector](https://github.com/BitMEX/api-connectors), I studied a lot from these projects.
